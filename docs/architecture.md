## 1. Introduction
The Revenue Tax & Transparency System (RTTS) is a modular, microservices-based platform designed to provide citizens, government officers, and the public with real-time tax and spending insights.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

- **Backend:** Golang microservices (taxpayer, payment, compliance, spending, notification, analytics)
- **Frontend:** Next.js web portals (citizen, admin, transparency)
- **Mobile:** React Native apps for citizens and officers
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL for transactions, MongoDB for logs/audits
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines
- **Integrations:** GovPay, LankaQR, M-Pesa, National ID systems, IRD e-services
